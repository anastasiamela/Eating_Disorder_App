# disorder_app

This Android app aims to support people with eating disorders. From the patient's point of view, the key features are meal, feeling and behaviour logging resulting in a comprehensive self-monitoring system. Also a patient can set goals, create and share coping skills, plan meals, receive tips about foods and their nutritional values and receive meal/goal specific reminders for their completion. From the doctor's point of view, he/she can track the logs from his/hers patients, comment on them and create coping skills for his/hers connected patients.
